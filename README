This project tries to solve the traveling salesman problem using the A* 
algorithm. There are 3 h* functions which can be used to measure which 
h* functions does a better job. 

Input File:
A pair of nodes and the cost of the edge between them.

Output File:
A text files showing the solutions to the puzzle if there is one.

H Functions:
H1:The Average cost of outgoing edges at node n to all children nodes that are reachable
times cities remain to be visited.

Example:Let's say we have 5 cities, since the start node needs to go back to 
itself the total of cities is 6. Everytime we move an additional level we substract
from 6 not 5. This is due to the fact that we have to go back to the start node.
